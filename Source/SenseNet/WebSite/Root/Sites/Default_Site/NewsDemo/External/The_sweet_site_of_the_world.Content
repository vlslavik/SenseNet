      <p>There is a little Charlie in everyone, just like in us! When we won the tender, childlike enthusiasm passed through the team.
      Who thought that creating a chocolate factory website could be so motivating?</p>

      <p>Did you think that a chocolate factory website has 15000 visitors per weekday and even more in the weekends?
      Everyone loves chocolate, so the target group could be specified as EVERYONE! Chocolate consumers come from very different
      areas of life, which means they are looking for different things on the factory website.</p>
      <p>This explains why the chocolate factory project was a real challenge for our Business Solutions team.
      The design needed to separate the content intended for various audiences. Entertainment for children, such as the Chocolate Labyrinth
      and Memory Game portlets were placed into the central portion of the landing page. Portlets targeting singles, like the calories calculator and
      the Dating with Chocolate applications got the right column.</p>
      <p>As Bonjour Chocolate Factory takes social responsibility for overweight children and for people living with diabetes seriously,
      body index calculators and the diabetes control campaign banners also got a prominent place on all pages.</p>
